  Abstract                 = {Recently, an interesting primary transmitter authentication scheme was proposed. The main idea of this scheme is to have the primary transmitter embed cryptographic authentication tag at the physical layer. There are a number of features that make this scheme attractive. In this paper, we investigate the effective coverage areas for the primary and secondary receivers before and after applying this scheme. During the process, we reveal a serious limitation of this scheme, which may prohibit its application in practice.},

  Review                   = {Problem: Ensuring adequate service coverage to primary and secondary users in spectrum sharing scenarios while authenticating the primary user signals.\\ \\ Solution: This paper points out an important limitation of the often proposed cryptographic watermarking for primary user authentication. The paper analyzes the bit-error rate and the effective service coverage of signals having cryptographic symbols embedded, both in comparison to signals with no embedding. The paper finds that at least 65% of secondary users will be unable to authenticate primary users due to the signal degradation caused by the cryptographic embedding. This paper is EXTREMELY important as it shows a very simple analysis of the limitations of cryptographic embedding, which seems VERY appealing if you listen to those who propose it in papers, with apparently no thought given to practical applications.\\ \\},

  Abstract                 = {Trust learning is a crucial aspect of information exchange, negotiation, and any other kind of social interaction among autonomous agents in open systems. But most current probabilistic models for computational trust learning lack the ability to take context into account when trying to predict future behavior of interacting agents. Moreover, they are not able to transfer knowledge gained in a specific context to a related context. Humans, by contrast, have proven to be especially skilled in perceiving traits like trustworthiness in such so-called initial trust situations. The same restriction applies to most multiagent learning problems. In complex scenarios most algorithms do not scale well to large state-spaces and need numerous interactions to learn. We argue that trust related scenarios are best represented in a system of relations to capture semantic knowledge. Following recent work on nonparametric Bayesian models we propose a flexible and context sensitive way to model and learn multidimensional trust values which is particularly well suited to establish trust among strangers without prior relationship. To evaluate our approach we extend a multiagent framework by allowing agents to break an agreed interaction outcome retrospectively. The results suggest that the inherent ability to discover clusters and relationships between clusters that are best supported by the data allows to make predictions about future behavior of agents especially when initial trust is involved.},

Therefore, a sensing policy is needed to decide which channels to sense. The channel selection problem is the problem of designing such a sensing policy to maximize throughput while avoiding interference to primary users. The channel selection problem can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem. Channel selection schemes that employ reinforcement machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to belief manipulation attacks that contaminate the knowledge base of the learning algorithms. In this paper, we analyze the security of channel selection algorithms that are based on reinforcement learning and propose mitigation techniques that make these algorithms more robust against belief manipulation attacks.},

  Abstract                 = {The cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks (CRN) is generally modelled as a distributed binary hypothesis testing problem. Existing literatures mostly deal with cooperative spectrum sensing where a central unit called fusion centre (FC) collects decisions from all secondary users (SUs) and takes the final decision. In this paper, we address the cooperative spectrum sensing scheme without the presence of FC. However, SUs can share their information with each other to make the decision process more reliable. Moreover, modelling of the system in presence of fading is an important issue. The decentralized cooperative spectrum sensing (DCSS) scheme is represented as probabilistic graphical model using factor graph and sum-product algorithm. The new DCSS scheme is proposed by employing likelihood ratio test (LRT) based decision fusion rule. It leads to Neyman-Pearson (N-P) criteria based optimal sensing. Convergence of global decision is also validated using both geographic and broadcast based gossip algorithm for communicating among SUs. Exhaustive simulation results are provided to validate the concept.},

  Abstract                 = {Physical layer security is an emerging technique to improve the wireless communication security, which is widely regarded as a complement to cryptographic technologies. To design physical layer security techniques under practical scenarios, the uncertainty and imperfections in the channel knowledge need to be taken into consideration. This paper provides a survey of recent research and development in physical layer security considering the imperfect channel state information (CSI) at communication nodes. We first present an overview of the main information-theoretic measures of the secrecy performance with imperfect CSI. Then, we describe several signal processing enhancements in secure transmission designs, such as secure on-off transmission, beamforming with artificial noise, and secure communication assisted by relay nodes or in cognitive radio systems. The recent studies of physical layer security in large-scale decentralized wireless networks are also summarized. Finally, the open problems for the on-going and future research are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {A cognitive radio (CR) is a transceiver that is aware, adaptive, and capable of learning. It may be visualized and realized as an intelligent software package (cognitive engine) controlling a software defined radio platform. The cognitive engine executes a set of nested loops constituting a cognition cycle, drawing on experience and stored knowledge to optimize a set of user-chosen quality of service measures. The process relies on the effectiveness of a set of tools that are individually well known but rarely found together: multi-objective genetic algorithms, case-based decision theory, and neural networks. Practical implementation problems include passing environmental information from the radio to the cognitive engine, acting on that information, and performing real-time control of the radio platform by the cognitive engine. In this paper, we discuss our approach to developing and implementing a CR.},

  Review                   = {Problem: Developing a cognitive engine for a cognitive radio which the authors define as being "a transceiver that is aware, adaptive, and capable of learning from experience. (this paper seems to be a survey paper that is more targetted than usual) Solution: The authors describe a high level architecture for a cognitive radio. They then go further by discussing specific implementation features for a cognitive engine in a cognitive radio such as using evolutionary techniques (genetic algorithms specifically) in the engine. The authors then discuss the problem that will arise of identifying particular signals when their channel parameters are unknown before communication time. They discuss applying artificial neural networks to his problem. The authors close by claiming that cognitive engines will continue to rise up the network stack. Why Did I Read It?: I want to read earlier works in cognitive radio to get a better clue of the progression of the field. I think this will be useful to both give me ideas and to eliminate ideas that have already been eliminated. Other Notes: I found this paper very rewarding. It was well written. It provided several cognitive radio conference names that I had not previously known about. It mentions a concrete implementation of a cognitive radio system that runs using GNU Radio which we have available to us! The cognitive radio implementation uses genetic algorithms in its cognitive engine. I intend to find this engine, download it, examine it, and see if it is possible to maliciously influence the cognitive engine into misbehaving.},

  Abstract                 = {The tutorial starts with an overview of the concepts of VC dimension and structural risk minimization. We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces important cognitive radio developments like spectrum sharing, learning and adaptation algorithms, and the software and hardware architecture to support these functions. A cognitive radio is defined here as a transceiver that is aware of its environment and can combine this awareness with knowledge of its user's priorities, needs, operational procedures, and governing regulatory rules. It adapts to its environment and configures itself in an appropriate fashion. The radio learns through experience and is capable of generating solutions for communications problems unforeseen by its designers. Our spectrum sharing cognitive radio is built upon GNU radio and uses the universal software radio peripheral (USRP) device as our radio front end platform. We use cyclostationary feature analysis to detect low SNR modulated signals because of its ability to distinguish between modulated signals, interference, and noise in low signal to noise ratios. A parallel algorithm running on a cell broadband engine (Cell BE) is used to attack the associated high computational complexity. A new spectrum sensing scheme, incorporating spectrum monitoring, data transmission, and dynamic channel switching, is designed to fully utilize the idle time of the primary user. Our work is based on the concept of a cognitive engine: an intelligent software package that "reads the meters" and "turns the knobs" of any attached software defined radio (SDR) platform. Using an eclectic combination of artificial intelligence techniques including case-based decision theory, multi-objective genetic algorithms, and neural networks, it implements a system of nested cognition loops. Applied to public safety communications, this technology is the basis of a working prototype Public Safety Cognitive Radio that can scan the public safety spectrum (multiple bands and multiple waveforms, all incompatible) and configure itself to interoperate with any public safety waveform that it finds within 0.- 1 seconds of determining that a signal is present.},

The main contribution the authors put forward is their use of a "wireless system genetic algorithm (WSGA)" in developing a cognitive engine capable of developing optimal operating procedures for myriad situations. The definition of the WSGA is limited to abstract objective function models, no specific objective functions are given. The authors also claim to have obtained good performance with their WSGA cognitive engine in both simulation and experiments, but no numerical results are provided.\\ \\ Why Did I Read It?: For two reasons, first I am investigating early cognitive radio literature and this certainly fits that description, and secondly I am interested in discovering existing cognitive radio implementations.\\ \\ Other Notes: It seems that I should contact the authors of this paper to see where I can obtain their cognitive radio source code for further study.\\ \\},

  Abstract                 = {Scanning large amounts of bandwidth for anomalous signals is a fundamental tool to building secure spectrum sharing system. When designing a bandwidth scanning algorithm, the system engineer faces several problems: which band to scan, how long to scan the band, and how to detect whether a malicious adversary is present. It is often not possible to conclusively detect an adversary's presence during a single scan, and therefore the anomaly detection procedure needs to run continuously. For a spectrum scanning system that runs continuously, it is possible to tune the algorithm to better detect the presence of a malicious threat by adapting one's belief as to whether the adversary is present, particularly if the previous scanning attempt failed to detect an adversary in the previous time slot. In this paper, by means of a game theoretical model, we demonstrate some approaches to solve these scanning problems. The equilibrium strategies in the suggested models are obtained explicitly, and thereby allows for interesting properties associated with the problems and related scanning algorithms to be established.},

For the scanner the game is one of resource allocation, which channel to scan in each timeslot, and for the attacker it is a game involving choosing a "pure strategy", which the authors note is best served by randomization. The authors then derives equilibrium strategies for both attacker and defender. The authors simulate their games and then devise an additional strategy for the defender to learn from experience which they give in formula form, followed by further evaluation.\\ \\},

  Abstract                 = {We present an authentication device allowing for the validation of wireless transmissions by means of a watermark signal applied at the physical layer, and demonstrate how the method may be applied to digital broadcast television signals. The novel watermarking approach presented conveys the authentication signal through explicit emulation of innocuous channel responses, further preventing Primary User Emulation attacks in Dynamic Spectrum Access theaters. The undesirable effects of the watermark signal design are removed by the receiver by traditional channel equalization practices, resulting in nearly zero impact to the bit error rate (BER) of the primary signal received. The proposed mechanism may be implemented without modification to existing Digital Television (DTV) transmission equipment using a retrofitting approach, and does not require the modification of existing receivers or protocols. A key benefit of the proposed method is that the authentication signal may be received at a BER much lower than the primary-signal, all within original transmission power and bandwidth constraints. We discuss physical layer details of the new watermarking method, and demonstrate how proven cryptographic authentication measures may be applied to the problem.},

This allows for nearly zero increase in the bit error rate (BER). The authors then describe using this scheme to embed cryptographic data of the form watermark = {TS, F, L, T, C, Sign_C(hash(TS, F, L, T))}, where TS is a timestampt, F is the signal's transmitting frequency, L is the location of the transmitter, T is the time where the transmitter is permitted to transmit, C is a public key infrastructure certificate, and Sign_C is the digital signature function using C.\\ \\ Why Did I Read It?: To gain more insight into solving the problem of primary user emulation in dynamic spectrum access scenarios.\\ \\ Other Notes: This is the second paper I've read concerning cryptographic watermarking, it seems to me that this will likely become the standard in the future. It's hard to imagine a better scheme. However, I have yet to see any experiments validating cryptographic watermarking, only simulations.

Protecting licensed broadcast television viewers from harmful interference due to secondary spectrum usage is critical to the successful deployment of TV white space devices. A wide variety of secondary system operating scenarios must be considered in any potential interference analysis, as described below. Several different types of licensed television transmitters currently exist in the TV bands, along with secondary licensed services, such as wireless microphones. All licensed services must be adequately protected from harmful interference, which can readily and reliably be achieved with the described geo-location database methods. Specific implementation details of geo-location databases are discussed, including several complexity reduction techniques.

This paper demonstrates a novel approach, which incorporates radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) into a wireless intrusion de tection system (IDS), for detecting this attack. RFF is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a transceiver based on the transient portion of the signal it generates. Moreover, the success rate of a wireless IDS is also im proved by correlating several observations in time, using a Bayesian filter. Simulation results, with an average suc cess rate of (94-100%), support the feasibility of employ ing RFF and Bayesian filtering techniques to successfully address the aforementioned problem.},

  Abstract                 = {With myriad augmented reality, social networking, and retail shopping applications all on the horizon for the mobile handheld, a fast and accurate location technology will become key to a rich user experience. When roaming outdoors, users can usually count on a clear GPS signal for accurate location, but indoors, GPS often fades, and so up until recently, mobiles have had to rely mainly on rather coarse-grained signal strength readings. What has changed this status quo is the recent trend of dramatically increasing numbers of antennas at the indoor access point, mainly to bolster capacity and coverage with multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) techniques. We thus observe an opportunity to revisit the important problem of localization with a fresh perspective. This paper presents the design and experimental evaluation of ArrayTrack, an indoor location system that uses MIMO-based techniques to track wireless clients at a very fine granularity in real time, as they roam about a building. With a combination of FPGA and general purpose computing, we have built a prototype of the ArrayTrack system. Our results show that the techniques we propose can pinpoint 41 clients spread out over an indoor office environment to within 23 centimeters median accuracy, with the system incurring just 100 milliseconds latency, making for the first time ubiquitous real-time, fine-grained location available on the mobile handset.},

The ArrayTrack system relies primarily upon several angle of arrivals (AoA) on an array of antennas to distinguish between the signal and its multipath components. In addition, several such access points are used, in different locations to obtain a lot of data which can then be used to accurately estimate signal location of origin within an accuracy of 23 cm.\\ \\ Why Did I Read It?: To aid my understanding of the work invovled in Changlai's project.\\ \\},

  Abstract                 = {Number of technologies has been developed in wireless communication and there is always a common issue in this field i.e. `Security' due to its open medium of communication. Now, spectrum allocation is becoming major problem in wireless communication due to paucity of available spectrum. Cognitive radio is one of the rapidly increasing technologies in wireless communication. Cognitive radio promises to detract spectrum shortage problem by allowing unlicensed users to co-exist with licensed users in spectrum band and use it for communication while causing no interference with licensed users. Cognitive radio technology intelligently detects vacant channels and allows unlicensed users to use that one, while avoiding occupied channels optimizing the use of available spectrum. Initially research in cognitive radios focused on resource allocation, spectrum sensing and management. Parallelly, another important issue that garnered attention of researchers from academia and industry is Security. Security considerations show that the unique characteristics of cognitive radio such as spectrum sensing and sharing make it vulnerable to new class of security threats and attacks. These security threats are challenge in the deployment of CRN and meeting Quality of Service (QoS). This is a survey paper in which we identified and discussed some of the security threats and attacks in spectrum sensing and cognitive radio networks. Together with discussing security attacks, we also proposed some techniques to mitigate the effectiveness of these attacks.},

  Review                   = {Problem: Survey paper on cognitive radio attacks and mitigation.\\ \\ Solution: This paper is a very limited survey that seemingly contains no new information for me. I have read almost all of the papers on cognitive radio cited for this paper and this contains nothing new. It contains one reference that I have seen for the second time that may be useful to read, but that is it.\\ \\},

  Abstract                 = {Unsolicited commercial email is a significant problem for users and providers of email services. While statistical spam filters have proven useful, senders of spam are learning to bypass these filters by systematically modifying their email messages. In a good word attack, one of the most common techniques, a spammer modifies a spam message by inserting or appending words indicative of legitimate email. In this paper, we describe and evaluate the effectiveness of active and passive good word attacks against two types of statistical spam filters: naive Bayes and maximum entropy filters. We find that in passive attacks without any filter feedback, an attacker can get 50 % of currently blocked spam past either filter by adding 150 words or fewer. In active attacks allowing test queries to the target filter, 30 words will get half of blocked spam past either filter. 1},

  Review                   = {Problem: Defeating spam filters by adding good words, also, improving spam filters against good word attacks.\\ \\ Solution: The authors use lists of good words to select words to add to spam e-mails that will make the e-mails be classified as good instead of spam. Two spam filter varieties are studied: Naive Bayes and MaxEntropy and the authors present two algorithms to accomplish their goal.\\ Both algorithms search for words that will cause a spam e-mail to cross the threshold between classification as a legitimate e-mail and classification as a spam e-mail. The first algorithm simply takes the first N words found to satisfy this requirement while the second algorithm seeks for the best N words that satisfy the requirement; best meaning words holding the highest weight, so that they can have the largest affect on an e-mail's classification as good or bad. \\ These algorithms are experimentally measured in active attacks and compared to general passive attacks where no feedback is possible. The authors obtained good results in both of these attacks with active attacks significantly improving effectiveness (as one might guess). It was found that the first algorithm (first N words) performed better with respect to number of queries while the second algorithm (best N words) was able to slightly reduce the number of words required to get the e-mail past the filter, at the cost of an increase in queries on the order of thousands.\\ After showing the efficacy of their spam filter defeating techniques the author propose how to improve spam filters. Their analysis suggests that the only method to protect against these attacks is frequent retraining. They found that retraining cut the efficacy of the first N attack by ~62% on the Naive Bayes filter and ~99% on the MaxEntropy filter. Retraining cut the efficacy of the best N attack by ~87% on the Naive Bayes filter and ~99% on the MaxEntropy filter. This indicates that the MaxEntropy filter is much more dependent on retraining than Naive Bayes.\\ Why Did I Read It?: I read this paper to continue my study into adversarial learning.},

At the same time, cognitive radio technology has received a lot of interest as a possible enabling technology. In this paper, we provide a brief description of the broad impact of cognitive radios in different markets. At Virginia Tech’s Center for Wireless Telecommunications (CWT), we have designed a biologically inspired cognitive engine with dynamic spectrum access (DSA) as one of its intended applications. An experimental software simulation shows a 20 dB SINR improvement using cognitive techniques in an interference environment over that provided by current IEEE 802.11a service PHY standard.},

  Review                   = {Problem: Increasing spectrum efficiency in a noisy environment. Solution: Cognitive radio driven by a cognitive engine which relies upon a multiple objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). In the author's specific simulation they use signal to noise ratio (SNR) as the primary limiting factor on spectrum efficiency. In short, the genetic algorithm's objective function was to avoid interference between users accessing the same access point. Their simulation takes the wireless 802.11a/g standard and bolts on a cognitive engine to aid in channel selection. They found in their results that each link's quality of service (QoS) was improved and that overall spectrum utilization was improved. Why Did I Read It?: I am continuing backwards in time to look at the origins of cognitive radio. I think I'm almost as far back as I will go... Other Notes: If we assume that genetic algorithms are indeed good for optimization, then I do not see anything particularly novel about the approach here. The case considered is so simple that it seems obvious that putting even a small amount of "thought" behind it would improve the situation...},

  Abstract                 = {The 2010 FCC ruling on white spaces proposes relying on a database of incumbents as the primary means of determining white space availability at any white space device (WSD). While the ruling provides broad guidelines for the database, the specifics of its design, features, implementation, and use are yet to be determined. Furthermore, architecting a network where all WSDs rely on the database raises several systems and networking challenges that have remained unexplored. Also, the ruling treats the database only as a storehouse for incumbents. We believe that the mandated use of the database has an additional opportunity: a means to dynamically manage the RF spectrum. Motivated by this opportunity, in this paper, we present SenseLess, a database-driven white spaces network. As suggested by its very name, in SenseLess, WSDs rely on a database service to determine white spaces availability as opposed to spectrum sensing. The service, using a combination of an up-to-date database of incumbents, sophisticated signal propagation modeling, and an efficient content dissemination mechanism to ensure efficient, scalable, and safe white space network operation. We build, deploy, and evaluate SenseLess and compare our results to ground truth spectrum measurements. We present the unique system design considerations that arise due to operating over the white spaces. We also evaluate its efficiency and scalability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that identifies and examines the systems and networking challenges that arise from operating a white space network, which is solely dependent on a channel occupancy database.},

  Review                   = {Problem: Implementing spectrum sharing in white spaces without spectrum sensing.\\ \\ Solution: SenseLess; a service relying on computing whitespace availability based on complex models of RF propagation. The authors lay out a system, which they also implement in C#, to use map data of varying granularity along with locations of primary users and operating parameters (power, antenna height, etc) to compute available spectrum at any given time. The authors propose this technique over active spectrum sensing for various reasons, a few of which are: active spectrum sensing is a power intensive operation that would be ill-suited to mobile radios, the FCC has ruled that spectrum sharing in whitespaces should be carried out using databases (as well as spectrum sensing). The system requires location data from users hoping to communicate in the whitespaces so that the basestation (which is connected over the Internet to the spectrum availability service) can accurately determine if there exists any possibility of interference with primary users based on propagation models. One proposed method in this paper to alert users of channel availability is to continuously broadcast a listing of available channels; a problem referred to as "bootstrapping".\\ \\ Why Did I Read It?: I am seeking out literature on database driven dynamic spectrum access techniques. It seems to be sparse, but worth mentioning in my paper.\\ \\ Other Notes: The bootstrapping solution proposed would definitely be vulnerable to falsification by malicious users. They could either simply jam the basestation or jam and replace with their own false signal. I can make the case for including PHY layer authentication in this.\\ \\},

Bluetooth v4.0 is the latest version of a wireless communication standard for low-speed and low-range data transfer among devices in a human's PAN. It allows increased network mobility among devices such as headsets, PDAs, wireless keyboards and mice. A pairing process is initiated when two devices desire to communicate, and this pairing needs to correctly authenticate devices so that a secret link key is established for secure communication. What is interesting is that device authentication relies on humans to communicate verification information between devices via a human-aided out-of-band channel. Bluetooth v4.0's SSP protocol is designed to offer security against passive eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. We conduct the first known detailed analysis of SSP for all its MitM-secure models. We highlight some issues related to exchange of public keys and use of the passkey in its models and discuss how to treat them properly.},

  Abstract                 = {This research focuses on developing a cognitive radio that could operate reliably in unforeseen communications environments like those faced by the disaster and emergency response communities. Cognitive radios may also offer the potential to open up secondary or complimentary spectrum markets, effectively easing the perceived spectrum crunch while providing new competitive wireless services to the consumer. A structure and process for embedding cognition in a radio is presented, including discussion of how the mechanism was derived from the human learning process and mapped to a mathematical formalism called the BioCR. Results from the implementation and testing of the model in a hardware test bed and simulation test bench are presented, with a focus on rapidly deployable disaster communications. Research contributions include developing a biologically inspired model of cognition in a radio architecture, proposing that genetic algorithm operations could be used to realize this model, developing an algorithmic framework to realize the cognition mechanism, developing a cognitive radio simulation toolset for evaluating the behavior the cognitive engine, and using this toolset to analyze the cognitive engine’s performance in different operational scenarios. Specifically, this research proposes and details how the chaotic meta-knowledge search, optimization, and machine learning properties of distributed genetic algorithm operations could be used to map this model to a computable mathematical framework in conjunction with dynamic multi-stage distributed memories. The system formalism is contrasted with existing cognitive radio approaches, including traditionally brittle artificial intelligence approaches. The cognitive engine architecture and algorithmic framework is developed and introduced, including the Wireless Channel Genetic Algorithm (WCGA), WirelessSystem Genetic Algorithm (WSGA), and Cognitive System Monitor (CSM). Experimental results show that the cognitive engine finds the best tradeoff between a host radio's operational parameters in changing wireless conditions, while the baseline adaptive controller only increases or decreases its data rate based on a threshold, often wasting usable bandwidth or excess power when it is not needed due its inability to learn. Limitations of this approach include some situations where the engine did not respond properly due to sensitivity in algorithm parameters, exhibiting ghosting of answers, bouncing back and forth between solutions. Future research could be pursued to probe the limits of the engine’s operation and investigate opportunities for improvement, including how best to configure the genetic algorithms and engine mathematics to avoid engine solution errors. Future research also could include extending the cognitive engine to a cognitive radio network and investigating implications for secure communications.},

The authors' simulation and experiment do indicate that their approach is successful in tuning radio parameters effectively.

The cognitive radio was able to keep the radio link active despite being forced (by the researchers) to remain on the frequency being jammed.\\ \\ Why Did I Read It?: I had hoped to gain insight into the inner workings of a cognitive engine reliant on genetic algorithms, since from my reading that seems to be a very popular choice.\\ \\ Other Thoughts: This paper was not particularly insightful.

  Abstract                 = {This paper throws light on the issue of spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks where the secondary users cooperatively sense the spectrum for identifying and accessing temporarily unoccupied frequency spectrum bands. Here, it is shown that this issue can be modeled as a cooperative game in order to allocate the spectrum resources fairly to each cognitive radio. The users form coalitions to jointly sense and share the spectrum bands. The worth of each user is calculated according to the work done by the user for the corresponding coalition with respect to the information collected about the primary user activity from sensing the spectrum band. Resulting games are balanced, thus ensuring non-empty cores for allocating resources to the users. It is also found that the games are also convex, hence enabling one-point solution concepts like the Shapley value, tau value and nucleolus which lie within the core to provide stability. The simulation results for the game model applied to the case of 5 users and 8 channels are also illustrated.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>This paper proposes "seamless customer identification" (SCI), a means to identify physically present customers without any effort on customers' part beyond a one-time opt-in. With SCI, customers need not present cards or operate smartphones to convey their identities. So, stores can provide personalized shopping experiences at any time, not just at check-out. SCI uses two complementary technologies: device detection and face recognition. Device detection identifies customers by detecting their phones through low-power wireless discovery, in our case using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Face recognition recognizes customers by matching pictures captured during registration with images captured by a store camera. Device detection makes face recognition feasible by limiting the number of potential customers, while face recognition provides directional information that device detection lacks. Together, these technologies provide an ordering of likely candidates to a store employee, who makes the final determination of identity. We have designed and built SCI, and demonstrated its usefulness in an application called Zero-Effort Payments (ZEP). ZEP uses SCI to let customers effortlessly make small purchases at a coffee stand. We conducted two real-world deployments of ZEP on actual customers: a two-day deployment during a technology fair and a four-month deployment in our building. Across both deployments, 274 customers made 705 purchases using ZEP. Through these deployments and other experiments, we demonstrate how our techniques make seamless customer identification feasible and practical.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce DropConnect, a generalization of DropOut, for regularizing large fully-connected layers within neural networks. When training with Dropout, a randomly selected subset of activations are set to zero within each layer. DropConnect instead sets a randomly selected subset of weights within the network to zero. Each unit thus receives input from a random subset of units in the previous layer. We derive a bound on the generalization performance of both Dropout and DropConnect. We then evaluate DropConnect on a range of datasets, comparing to Dropout, and show state-of-the-art results on several image recoginition benchmarks can be obtained by aggregating multiple DropConnect-trained models.},

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive Radio (CR) is a novel technology that promises to solve the lack of spectrum by allowing secondary users to use licensed band, so that they can coexist with primary users without causing interference to their communications. With the development of CR, extending to the level of network, cognitive radio networks (CRNs) emerge as the times require. Nowadays the operational aspects of CRN are being explored vigorously, and several potential security challenges for cognitive radio have gained lots of attention. In this paper, we explore the security issues on physical layer for cognitive radio networks. First, we give a brief overview of the CRNs, then we review several existing secure threats to the physical layer in CRNs and we propose a new kind of security problem. Next, we discuss the related countermeasures on how to defend against these attacks. Subsequently, we conduct an evaluation of these countermeasures, and make some future works for secure CRNs. At last, we make the conclusion.},

In addition, this survey takes into account three different varieties of cognitive radio networks: peer-to-peer, infrastructure driven (like cellular networks), and (in my opinion the most likely scenario) mesh networks which are a mix between the two previous varieties. \\ Why Did I Read It?: To survey the style in which cognitive radio survey papers are being written as well as to find a new resource for discovering new papers relating to cognitive radio security. \\ \\},

In this paper, we focus on defending against the jamming attack, one of the major threats to cognitive radio networks. Secondary users can exploit the flexible access to multiple channels as the means of anti-jamming defense. We first investigate the situation where a secondary user can access only one channel at a time and hop among different channels, and model it as an anti-jamming game. Analyzing the interaction between the secondary user and attackers, we derive a channel hopping defense strategy using the Markov decision process approach with the assumption of perfect knowledge, and then propose two learning schemes for secondary users to gain knowl- edge of adversaries to handle cases without perfect knowledge. In addition, we extend to the scenario where secondary users can access all available channels simultaneously, and redefine the anti-jamming game with randomized power allocation as the defense strategy. We derive the Nash equilibrium for this Colonel Blotto game which minimizes the worst-case damage. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the performance.},

The authors create several different game models to fit different scenarios. First, they create an anti-jamming game, where utility is gained from communication and a certain amount of utility is lost from having to hop channels. The authors then examine how Markov decision processes (MDPs) can be used to reason about strategies for this game. The MDP model assumes perfect knowledge Second, the authors examine feeding the MDP with learned knowledge from experience. The authors examine how well MLE-Based learning works and how well Q-Learning works. Third, the authors formulate a new game with enough radios to cover all channels but a constrained power budget; the power allocation game examines how a secondary user should allocate power to minimize jamming. \\ \\ Why Did I Read It?: I am aware that game theory is a popular paradigm to apply to cognitive radios, I decided I should examine it to see if I can find any security implications. Since the authors are using learning it is my hope that I can find a way to attack this approach to instill malicious or false beliefs into the learning engine. \\ \\ Other Notes: The authors give very rigorous proofs and models in this paper and it is very thorough.

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive radio technology has been proposed to improve spectrum efficiency by having the cognitive radios act as secondary users to opportunistically access under-utilized frequency bands. Spectrum sensing, as a key enabling functionality in cognitive radio networks, needs to reliably detect signals from licensed primary radios to avoid harmful interference. However, due to the effects of channel fading/shadowing, individual cognitive radios may not be able to reliably detect the existence of a primary radio. In this paper, we propose an optimal linear cooperation framework for spectrum sensing in order to accurately detect the weak primary signal. Within this framework, spectrum sensing is based on the linear combination of local statistics from individual cognitive radios. Our objective is to minimize the interference to the primary radio while meeting the requirement of opportunistic spectrum utilization. We formulate the sensing problem as a nonlinear optimization problem. By exploiting the inherent structures in the problem formulation, we develop efficient algorithms to solve for the optimal solutions. To further reduce the computational complexity and obtain solutions for more general cases, we finally propose a heuristic approach, where we instead optimize a modified deflection coefficient that characterizes the probability distribution function of the global test statistics at the fusion center. Simulation results illustrate significant cooperative gain achieved by the proposed strategies. The insights obtained in this paper are useful for the design of optimal spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks.},

  Review                   = {The authors frame cooperative spectrum sensing decisions in the form of several different optimization problems, the simplest of them being solvable using Linear programming. The authors concern themselves with three classes of performance with respect to opportunistic spectrum utilization: conservative system, aggressive system, hostile system. The authors demonstrate how to optimize for each of these cases using percentage constraints levied upon each of these three classes.},
